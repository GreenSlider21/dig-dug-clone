# Reflection
- what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
    - Probably to attempt the a* before I have a bunch of other clutter that will potentially interfere so that the a* is a more base component that I build the rest of the game around. 


- did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
    - Yes I was able to complete everything in my need to have list as well as a few things in my want to have.

- What was the hardest part of the project?
    - Figuring out a good enough ai that follows the player without being insanely unfair. First I tried to use A* pathfinding but I couldn’t really get anything going with that. After a good many days I was able to figure out a work around that just compares enemy positions with player positions to make the enemy move towards the player.

- Were there any problems you could not solve?
    - I was hoping to be able to reset the grid every level, but I think the ability to keep your paths works because it adds some strategy to how to beat the enemies when they become insanely fast.

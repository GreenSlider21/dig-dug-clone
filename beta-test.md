# Beta Test Notes

## Non-CompSci Person
- The Good
    - Liked the sounds
    - The score until 1UP is cool
    - Seems to work pretty good

- The Bad
    - Needs a clear explanation of controls
    - Not really sure what the goal is
    - Seems kinda fast

## CompSci Person
- The Good
    - Liked the sounds, really feels like i'm hitting them
    - The progress bar is pretty cool
    - Pretty solid overall

- The Bad
    - Slight sound bug and kinda loud
    - Needs some way to tell the player how to do things
    - Kinda a problem that they kinda go through the attack sometimes
    - A puase button would be nice
